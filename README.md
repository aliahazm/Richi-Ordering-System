## Introduction
Currently, Richiamo Coffee's ordering system is still following the traditional way where customers have to order and make payment over the counter. Therefore, Richi Ordering System has been decided for this project to help make ordering easier and efficient for the customers and also the staffs. This system can help customers to make orders and payment just from their smartphones without having to go to the counter.

## Objectives
1. To ease the ordering process.
2. To shorten the time to complete every order.
