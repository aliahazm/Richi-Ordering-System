## Introduction
Currently, Richiamo Coffee's ordering system is still following the traditional way where customers have to order and make payment over the counter. It is quite a hassle when customers have to wait for a long queue just to make an order and then wait again to receive the order. Therefore, Richi Ordering System has been decided for this project to help make ordering easier and efficient for the customers and also the staffs. This system can help customers to make orders just from their smartphones without having to go to the counter.

## Objective
1. To ensure the smoothness of ordering process by making it more efficient.
2. To ensure that customer can order faster without having to go to the counter.
3. To help shorten the time in completing each order.
